<h1>Project:  Hackathon</h1>

Hackathon is a 24h programming challenge where we were separated in teams of 6 and each team had to develop an application about a secret theme that was revealed just before the challenge started.

The theme of my Hackathon was the singer António Variações, each team received one of his songs to create an application related to it.

Our song was “O corpo é que paga”, which means “Is the body who suffers”. So, we took a couple of hours to brainstorm about it and we decide to develop a Pomodoro Application that helps reduce sedentarism and increase the user’s productivity by establishing tasks of a predetermined time and suggesting a variety of short sequences workout exercises and others short activities for the case that you can’t perform physical activities at the moment (e.g. working in an office).

To develop this application, we divide the team into three main responsibilities (Back-end / Full Stack / Front-end), with two members in each, to take advantage of the best skill of each member, but always helping each other when needed.

<STRONG>IMPORTANT NOTES:</STRONG> 
 - This is a mobile App, so you´ll need to shrink your window to access our app.
 - The "30m" button is set to 2 seconds intentionally for testing purposes.

<h2> Technologies: </h2>
The technologies used on this project were <b>JavaScript</b>, <b>HTML</b>, and <b>CSS</b> and the project management methodologies were <b>SCRUM</b>, with briefing each 2h to keep everyone updated and to make decisions about tasks not completed on the established time.
